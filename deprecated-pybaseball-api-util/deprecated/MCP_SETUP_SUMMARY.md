# Claude Desktop MCP Setup Summary

## ✅ Configuration Complete

Both the **ESPN Fantasy Baseball** and **PyBaseball Statistics** MCP servers are now configured to automatically start when Claude Desktop launches.

## Configuration Location

**Claude Desktop Config File:** `/Users/geraldgugger/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`

## Configured MCP Servers

### 1. ESPN Baseball (`espn-baseball`)
- **Purpose:** Fantasy baseball data, team stats, player information
- **Startup Script:** `/Users/geraldgugger/Code/the-genius/espn-api-util/start_baseball_mcp_simple.sh`
- **Working Directory:** `/Users/geraldgugger/Code/the-genius/espn-api-util`

### 2. PyBaseball Statistics (`pybaseball-stats`)
- **Purpose:** MLB statistics, player stats, standings, league leaders
- **Startup Script:** `/Users/geraldgugger/Code/the-genius/pybaseball-api-util/start_pybaseball_mcp_claude.sh`
- **Server Implementation:** `pybaseball_mcp_server_v2.py` (with proper MCP stdio support)
- **Working Directory:** `/Users/geraldgugger/Code/the-genius/pybaseball-api-util`

## Available Tools

### ESPN Baseball Tools
- Fantasy team management
- Player information and stats
- Team statistics
- League data

### PyBaseball Tools
- `player_stats` - Get season statistics for MLB players
- `player_recent_performance` - Get recent game performance
- `search_players` - Search for players by name
- `mlb_standings` - Get current MLB standings
- `stat_leaders` - Get league leaders for specific stats
- `team_statistics` - Get team aggregate statistics
- `clear_stats_cache` - Clear statistics cache
- `health_check` - Check server status

## How It Works

1. **Automatic Startup:** When Claude Desktop launches, it reads the configuration file and automatically starts both MCP servers
2. **Stdio Communication:** The servers communicate with Claude Desktop using the MCP protocol over stdin/stdout
3. **Tool Integration:** The tools become available in Claude conversations without manual setup

## Usage in Claude

Once configured, you can ask Claude to:
- "Show me Shohei Ohtani's batting stats for 2024"
- "Who are the home run leaders in the AL?"
- "Get the current MLB standings"
- "Find players with 'Rodriguez' in their name"
- "What are the Yankees' team statistics?"

## Troubleshooting

If the MCP servers don't start:

1. **Check Configuration:** Run `python test_mcp_setup.py` from the pybaseball-api-util directory
2. **Restart Claude Desktop:** Completely quit and restart the application
3. **Check Logs:** Look at Claude Desktop's console logs for error messages
4. **Verify Scripts:** Ensure both startup scripts are executable and dependencies are installed

## Testing

Run the verification script:
```bash
cd pybaseball-api-util
python test_mcp_setup.py
```

This will verify:
- ✅ Config file exists and is valid JSON
- ✅ Both MCP servers are configured
- ✅ Startup scripts exist and are executable

## Next Steps

1. **Restart Claude Desktop** if it's currently running
2. **Test the integration** by asking Claude about baseball statistics
3. **Enjoy seamless access** to both ESPN fantasy data and comprehensive MLB statistics!
